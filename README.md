Slide 1:
Hello everyone, and welcome to my presentation on how to build a ChatGPT app using SwiftUI. My name is [your name], and I'm excited to show you how to create a natural language chatbot using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model.

Slide 2:
So, what exactly is ChatGPT? Essentially, it's a chatbot that uses advanced natural language processing algorithms to carry out conversations with users in a way that feels natural and human-like. It can be used for a variety of purposes, such as customer service, language learning, or even just for fun.

Slide 3:
Now, you might be wondering why we're using SwiftUI to build this app. Well, SwiftUI is a powerful and intuitive framework for building user interfaces in Swift, Apple's programming language for iOS and macOS development. It offers a wide range of features that make it easy to create complex UI components, and it's fully compatible with OpenAI's APIs.

Slide 4:
Let's dive into the first step of building our ChatGPT app: creating the UI. SwiftUI offers a variety of components that we can use to create a chat window, message bubbles, and other UI elements. Here's an example of what our UI might look like:

Slide 5:
To create the UI, we'll need to use a combination of VStacks, HStacks, and other SwiftUI components. Here's some example code that demonstrates how to create a message bubble:

[Insert code snippet]

Slide 6:
Next, let's talk about how to integrate with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model. First, you'll need to obtain API credentials from OpenAI's website. Once you've done that, you can start making API calls to the model. Here's some example code that demonstrates how to send a request to the API:

[Insert code snippet]

Slide 7:
When we receive a response from the API, we'll need to parse the data and display it in our UI. We can do this by creating a new message bubble and adding it to the chat window. Here's some example code that demonstrates how to handle the API response:

[Insert code snippet]

Slide 8:
Now that we've covered the basics of integrating with OpenAI, let's talk about how to handle user input. We'll need to capture the user's message and send it to the API

Slide 8:
Now that we've covered the basics of integrating with OpenAI, let's talk about how to handle user input. We'll need to capture the user's message and send it to the API. To do this, we can use a TextField component to capture the user's text input, and then create a new message bubble and add it to the chat window. Here's some example code that demonstrates how to handle user input:

[Insert code snippet]

Slide 9:
Of course, we'll also need to handle errors and provide appropriate responses if the user's input is invalid or the API returns an error. Here's some example code that demonstrates how to handle errors:

[Insert code snippet]

Slide 10:
And that's it! We've covered the basics of building a ChatGPT app using SwiftUI and OpenAI. Of course, there's a lot more that you can do with this app, such as adding more advanced natural language processing features or integrating it with other APIs. But hopefully, this presentation has given you a good starting point for building your own ChatGPT app. Thanks for listening!

:speech_balloon: **Chantil**

> Please provide the code snippets.

:robot: **ChatGPT**

Sure, here are some code snippets that demonstrate how to create the UI, integrate with OpenAI's API, and handle user input and errors.

Creating the UI:

```swift
struct ChatBubble: View {
    var message: String
    var isMe: Bool
    
    var body: some View {
        HStack {
            if !isMe {
                Image(systemName: "person.fill")
            }
            Text(message)
                .padding(10)
                .foregroundColor(.white)
                .background(isMe ? Color.blue : Color.gray)
                .cornerRadius(10)
            if isMe {
                Image(systemName: "person.fill")
            }
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @State var messages: [String] = []
    @State var newMessage = ""
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            ScrollView {
                ForEach(messages.indices, id: \.self) { index in
                    ChatBubble(message: messages[index], isMe: index % 2 == 0)
                }
            }
            HStack {
                TextField("Type your message", text: $newMessage)
                Button("Send") {
                    messages.append(newMessage)
                    newMessage = ""
                }
            }
            .padding()
        }
    }
}
```

Integrating with OpenAI's API:

```swift
class OpenAIService {
    let apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY"
    let url = URL(string: "https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/davinci-codex/completions")!
    
    func generateResponse(prompt: String, completionHandler: @escaping (String?, Error?) -> Void) {
        var request = URLRequest(url: url)
        request.addValue("Bearer \(apiKey)", forHTTPHeaderField: "Authorization")
        request.addValue("application/json", forHTTPHeaderField: "Content-Type")
        request.httpMethod = "POST"
        let parameters: [String: Any] = ["prompt": prompt, "max_tokens": 50, "temperature": 0.7]
        request.httpBody = try? JSONSerialization.data(withJSONObject: parameters, options: [])
        let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: request) { data, response, error in
            guard let data = data, error == nil else {
                completionHandler(nil, error)
                return
            }
            let responseString = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8)
            completionHandler(responseString, nil)
        }
        task.resume()
    }
}
```

Handling user input and errors:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State var messages: [String] = []
    @State var newMessage = ""
    let openAIService = OpenAIService()
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            ScrollView {
                ForEach(messages.indices, id: \.self) { index in
                    ChatBubble(message: messages[index], isMe: index % 2 == 0)
                }
            }
            HStack {
                TextField("Type your message", text: $newMessage)
                Button("Send") {
                    messages.append(newMessage)
                    openAIService.generateResponse(prompt: newMessage) { response, error in
                        DispatchQueue.main.async {
                            if let response = response {
                                messages.append(response)
                            } else {
                                messages.append("Error: \(error?.localizedDescription ?? "Unknown error")")
                            }
                        }
                    }
                    newMessage = ""
                }
            }
            .padding()
        }
    }
}
```

Note that you'll need to replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual OpenAI API key.

> What does it mean that SwiftUI is compatible with OpenAI's APIs?

:robot: **ChatGPT**

Compatibility with OpenAI's APIs means that SwiftUI can seamlessly integrate with the OpenAI platform and make use of its powerful natural language processing capabilities. This allows for the creation of chatbots and other conversational applications that can interact with users in a human-like manner. Specifically, SwiftUI can be used to create the user interface for the chatbot, while OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model can be used to generate the chatbot's responses based on the user's input.

:speech_balloon: **Chantil**

> Given a sample JSON response

```
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-123",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": 1677652288,
  "choices": [{
    "index": 0,
    "message": {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "\n\nHello there, how may I assist you today?",
    },
    "finish_reason": "stop"
  }],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 9,
    "completion_tokens": 12,
    "total_tokens": 21
  }
}
```

> Please modify the code below to return `responseString` as the `content` of the first `message` of `choices`.

```
let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: request) { data, response, error in
            guard let data = data, error == nil else {
                completionHandler(nil, error)
                return
            }
            let responseString = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8)
            completionHandler(responseString, nil)
        }
```

:robot: **ChatGPT**

Sure, here's the modified code that extracts the `content` of the first `message` of `choices` from the JSON response:

```
let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: request) { data, response, error in
    guard let data = data, error == nil else {
        completionHandler(nil, error)
        return
    }
    
    do {
        let json = try JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: data, options: []) as? [String: Any]
        
        if let choices = json?["choices"] as? [[String: Any]],
           let message = choices.first?["message"] as? [String: Any],
           let content = message["content"] as? String {
            completionHandler(content, nil)
        } else {
            completionHandler(nil, error)
        }
    } catch {
        completionHandler(nil, error)
    }
}
``` 

This modified code uses `JSONSerialization` to parse the JSON response and extract the `content` of the first `message` of `choices`. If the extraction is successful, the `completionHandler` is called with `content` as the first argument. If the extraction fails, `completionHandler` is called with an error.

> Can you explain what the code is doing.

```
struct ChatBubble: View {
    var message: String
    var isMe: Bool
    
    var body: some View {
        HStack {
            if !isMe {
                Image(systemName: "person.fill")
            }
            Text(message)
                .padding(10)
                .foregroundColor(.white)
                .background(isMe ? Color.blue : Color.gray)
                .cornerRadius(10)
            if isMe {
                Image(systemName: "person.fill")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

:robot: **ChatGPT**

Sure! 

This code defines a `ChatBubble` struct, which is used to create a chat bubble view in our app. The `ChatBubble` struct takes in two parameters:

- `message`: the message text to display in the chat bubble.
- `isMe`: a boolean value indicating whether the chat bubble represents a message sent by the user (`true`) or by the chatbot (`false`).

The `body` property of `ChatBubble` defines the view hierarchy for the chat bubble. It creates an `HStack` view, which horizontally aligns the views within it. 

Inside the `HStack`, the `ChatBubble` first checks if `isMe` is `false`, indicating that the chat bubble is representing a chatbot message. If so, it displays an image of a person to represent the chatbot. If `isMe` is `true`, indicating that the chat bubble is representing a user message, this image is not shown. 

After the image, a `Text` view is added to display the `message` text. The text is then padded with 10 points of padding on all sides, and its text color is set to white. The `background` modifier sets the background color of the text view to blue if `isMe` is `true` (representing a user message), or gray if `isMe` is `false` (representing a chatbot message). Finally, the `cornerRadius` modifier rounds the corners of the chat bubble view to make it look more like a speech bubble.

After the text view, another person image is displayed if `isMe` is `true`. 

Overall, this code defines a simple and reusable chat bubble view that can be used to display chat messages in our app.

:speech_balloon: **Chantil**

> Make it more colloquial into a transcript for presentation.

:robot: **ChatGPT**

Sure! This code defines a chat bubble view for our app. You know, those little bubbles that you see in chat apps where messages are displayed. This particular chat bubble can display a message and show an image of a person to represent either the chatbot or the user depending on who sent the message. 

It uses an `HStack` to align the views within it. So, the image of a person is first displayed, followed by a text view that shows the message. The text view is then given some padding and its background color is set depending on who sent the message. If it's a user message, the background color is blue, and if it's a chatbot message, it's gray. Finally, the corners of the chat bubble are rounded, and another person image is displayed if the message was sent by the user. 

This code is reusable, so we can use it to display all the messages in our chat interface. And, it makes our chat interface look much more polished and professional.

            }
        }
        task.resume()
    }
}
```

:robot: **ChatGPT**

Sure! This is a Swift code that defines a class called `OpenAIService`, which has a function called `generateResponse`. This function takes in a prompt (a message to generate a response for) and a completion handler (a function that gets called when the response is ready).

Inside the function, it creates a URL request to the OpenAI chat API with the necessary headers and parameters, including the prompt message. It then sends the request to the API using a data task with a completion handler. When the API returns a response, it checks if it was successful and tries to extract the generated response message from the JSON data.

If the response is successful and the generated response message is found, the completion handler is called with the message. Otherwise, the completion handler is called with an error.

> Write a transcript to explain how to obtain an API key from OpenAI website.

:robot: **ChatGPT**

Sure, I can explain how to obtain an API key from OpenAI's website.

First, go to the OpenAI website at openai.com. Next, click on the "Sign In" button in the top-right corner of the page. If you don't have an account yet, you'll need to create one by clicking on the "Create an account" button and following the prompts.

Once you're signed in, click on your name in the top-right corner of the page and select "API Keys" from the dropdown menu. On the API Keys page, click the "New API Key" button, give your API key a name and select the permissions you want to grant it.

After you've created your API key, you'll be able to view it on the API Keys page. Make sure to copy it to a safe place, as you won't be able to see it again after you leave the page.

That's it! You now have an API key that you can use to access OpenAI's APIs.

Sure! This is a SwiftUI code that creates a chat view where a user can enter a message and receive a response generated by OpenAI's API. 

The `ContentView` is a SwiftUI `View` struct that initializes three properties using `@State` property wrappers: `messages`, `newMessage`, and `openAIService`. `messages` is an array of `String` type that will store all the messages sent and received by the user. `newMessage` is a string that will store the message entered by the user. `openAIService` is an instance of the `OpenAIService` class that provides the method to generate responses from OpenAI's API.

The main body of the `ContentView` is a `VStack` that contains two subviews. The first subview is a `ScrollView` that displays all the messages in the `messages` array using the `ForEach` loop. The `ChatBubble` is a custom SwiftUI view that is used to display individual chat messages. Each message is represented as a `ChatBubble` view and displayed in a row, alternating between blue and gray backgrounds.

The second subview is an `HStack` that contains an input field for the user to type a new message and a `Button` that sends the message to OpenAI's API. The `Button` calls the `generateResponse` method of the `openAIService` instance, which takes `newMessage` as a parameter. The `generateResponse` method makes a request to the OpenAI API using the `URLRequest` and `URLSession` classes. If the request is successful, the response is returned to the `completionHandler` closure and the `messages` array is updated with the new response.

Overall, this code creates a basic chat interface that allows users to interact with OpenAI's API to generate responses to their messages.

:robot: **ChatGPT**

Sure, here's a possible transcript for the slide you described:

Slide Title: Behind the Scenes

Subtitle: Experimenting with ChatGPT as a Content Generator

Image: Screenshot of the presenter asking ChatGPT to prepare the presentation content

List Items:

- Outline: The outline generated by ChatGPT did not match the presenter's intended structure. However, it provided a starting point for the presenter to modify and refine.

- Transcript: The transcript generated by ChatGPT for each slide was not always accurate or colloquial. The presenter had to spend time editing and simplifying the language.

- Code Snippets: The code snippets generated by ChatGPT were not always suitable for the presenter's needs. In one case, it used a deprecated model instead of the intended GPT-3.5 model. The presenter had to verify and modify the code as needed.

Overall, while ChatGPT provided a convenient way to generate content, the presenter needed to be aware of its limitations and spend time refining the output.

> Make the transcript more colloquial

:robot: **ChatGPT**

Sure, here's a more colloquial transcript for your "behind the scenes" section:

Hey everyone, I wanted to give you a peek behind the scenes of this tech sharing session. So, I was experimenting to see if it's possible to fully rely on ChatGPT to prepare the contents for this presentation. To do this, I asked ChatGPT to generate an outline, transcripts for each slide, and code snippets. But unfortunately, the transcript generated by ChatGPT didn't match my outline, and the code snippet it provided used a deprecated model instead of the GPT-3.5 model I wanted to use.

However, I still think it's interesting to see how far we've come with language models like ChatGPT. And even though I had to make some adjustments to the content generated by ChatGPT, I'm excited to see how this technology can continue to improve and help us with tasks like content creation in the future.
